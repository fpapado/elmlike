## Features

## Install

This package is distributed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

```shell
$ npm install --save elmlike
# or
$ yarn add elmlike
```

Then import according to your modules model and bundler, such as [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/):

```js
// ES Modules
// For all possible functions to import look at the documentation
import * as Maybe from "elmlike/maybe";

/// CommonJS modules
const Maybe = require("elmlike/maybe");
```

A [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) version is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/elmlike/dist/elmlike.umd.js"></script>
```

## Motivation

I love Elm's types and their API.
I like that they are concrete, and easy to grasp, with a minimal API surface.
I often write similar ad-hoc types when working in JS, and wanted a common point for them.

## Usage

### Quick Start

If you want to just dive in, do this:

```js
// TODO :)
```

## Examples

TODO: Write about common patterns, imports and so on
